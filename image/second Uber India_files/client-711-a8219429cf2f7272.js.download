This offer is only available to new delivery people who have never previously\n      signed up to drive or deliver with Uber; and (ii) complete 145 unique deliveries in Washington D.C. within 90 days of signing up with Uber\n      in Washington D.C.. If you don’t earn at least $1,200 for the first 145 deliveries in 90 days, then you’ll receive the difference between\n      $1,200 and your earnings. Earnings from your fares (after services fees and certain charges are deducted, such as city or local government\n      charges), tips, and incentives (including surge and trip supplements but excluding Quest ) are included toward your offer amount. Any payment\n      due will be automatically added to your account after you complete the required trips. Each completed delivery counts as one delivery towards\n      your minimum delivery requirement. Only deliveries with Uber Eats are eligible for this offer. Cancelled deliveries do not count. This offer\n      is only valid for those who received it from Uber (via an email, an ad or unique referral link), meet the eligibility requirements and signed\n      up at the landing page associated with this offer. Uber reserves the right to withhold or deduct payments that it determines or believes were\n      in error, fraudulent, illegal or in violation of the driver terms or these terms. Limited time only. Offer and terms are subject to change.\n      This block dynamically pulls legal text from a promotion.\n    </p>\n    "}};var d=n(93878);function u(e){const{guaranteeInfo:r,rtl:n}=e,{isLoading:t=!0,error:i,legal:o}=r,a=!i;return(0,l.tZ)(l.HY,{children:a&&o&&(0,l.tZ)(d.zW,{isLoading:t,error:i,children:(0,l.tZ)(s,{rtl:n||!1,body:{htmlContent:o}})})})}const h=(0,t.qC)((0,i.w)("loadDriverGuarantee"),(0,o.$j)((function(e){let{DGInfo:r}=e;return{guaranteeInfo:r}})))(u)}}]);
